    "Our God is Jehovah El Shaddai (the One who is more than enough, who can do much more than we expect). He doesn’t know how to do small things, he does not stop when your cup is full [Psalms 23:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023%3A5&version=KJV), according to [Psalms 68:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2068%3A19&version=KJV), he loads us with benefits. God doesn’t stop when all needs are met, he makes sure that there would never be any need again [2 Kings 4:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204%3A1-7&version=KJV).

In the wedding at Cana Jesus did not just provide wine, he gave the best wine [John 2:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A1-10&version=KJV). In [Joel 2:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202%3A26-27&version=KJV), God made a promise that you shall never be ashamed and in the name of Jesus, you will never see shame.

He is ready to carry you all the way through until the end [Matthew 14:22-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A22-33&version=KJV). Not only will he stand by you in trouble like he promised in [Isaiah 43:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043%3A1-2&version=KJV), he remains with you in the fire. One might ask why the fire experience if you will be there with me?
